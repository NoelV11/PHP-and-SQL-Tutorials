# PHP-and-SQL-Tutorials

PHP is a programming language used to connect databases and interact with the back-end of any website.This repository aims to integrate a backend database,onto a functioning website,using PHP and PHPMyAdmin.

## Functionalities of PHP
- Enable the working of a database and it's connectivity
- Deals with the configuration details of a database,on localhost
- "GET" information from user interacting with the website.Usually in the form of login systems or forms
- Store information into the database connected in the backend
- "RECIEVE" information requested by user.

## Functionalities of SQL
- Maintain records
- Ability to define type of data to be stored in them
- Used as data collection,on websites,for form fillups,information gathering etc.
- It has a database,table,row,column heirarchy

## Motivation

I have personally faced nightmares integrating a database to a website's backend.The problem may be down to simple PHPMyAdmin configuration or PHP Programming errors,so I created this repository to guide others from falling into the rabiit holes I fell into.

## Tools Used

- Brackets IDE
- PHPMyAdmin
- XAMPP Server

## Improvements

This repository is open to the public,to collaborate and contribute.Get in touch with me and I would be more than happy
